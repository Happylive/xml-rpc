# XML-RPC

An XML-RPC client and server in JavaScript.

* Client and server for Node.js.

* Client for the browser.

* Pure JavaScript.

* Written by one of the designers of the protocol.

### Client and server for Node.js

### Client for the browser

The core file for the browser version is <a href="https://github.com/scripting/xml-rpc/blob/master/client/xmlrpc.js">xmlrpc.js</a> in the client folder. 

It uses routines in several of my libraries: 

utils.js -- stringMid, stringNthField, filledString, encodeXml, 

xml.js -- xmlGetAddress, 

It also uses jQuery.
